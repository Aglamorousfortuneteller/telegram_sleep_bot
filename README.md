# Telegram Sleep Bot

- **Log Wake**: Users can log their wake-up time using the `/wake` command and get the total duration of their sleep.
- **Sleep Quality**: After waking up, users can rate their sleep quality from 0 to 10 using the `/quality` command.
- **Notes**: Users can add notes for their sleep sessions using the `/notes` command.
- **View Records**: Users can view all their past sleep records or the most recent one with `/view_records` and `/view_last_record`.
